# up

- Version 0.1.x of `up` provides a simple bash script for automating the installation of a few commonly required tools.
- Version â‰¥0.2.0 will provide a TUI (described below)

# Roadmap

The tool is now being extended to provide a Text User Interface (TUI) for:
1. Orchestrating the creation and management of infrastructure, using terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
2. Provisioning known servers using Ansible
3. Managing containerised services (initially limtied to docker compose on a single server)

`up` will be configured by users for their specific needs using standard terraform, ansible, docker compose and .env files.

## Installation

## Example usage
